ShopKaro is an advanced e-commerce platform designed with a comprehensive set of functionalities.
As I progress with the development, I intend to incorporate additional sophisticated features and 
integrations, aiming to elevate the complexity and showcase a broad spectrum of my skills and knowledge 
acquired throughout the project.

and i have used Redux(RTK) for state management
